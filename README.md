## Introduction

### The Project

Temari Share is a student-centered educational resource management system that allows students to share modules, presentations, documents, tutorial videos, projects, assignments, and other educational resources.

### The Context

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Term at [ALX School](https://www.alxafrica.com/). We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
